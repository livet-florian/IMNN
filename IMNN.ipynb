This prevents us needing to define an ϵ parameter to define the acceptance distance. Instead we start with a population from the prior and iteratively move samples inwards. Once it becomes difficult to move the population any more, i.e. the number of attempts to accept a parameter becomes very large, then the distribution is seen to be a stable approximation to the posterior.\n",
